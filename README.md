# Generalizable Robotic Manipulation

This project aims at pose-aware robotic manipulation for a category of object. Different from most existing pose aware manipulation algorithms that most contain an explicit pose estimation, we define the object target configuration on top of semantic keypoints. In this way, the proposed pipeline can handle potentially unknown objects with substantial variations on shape, appearance and topology.
